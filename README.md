# My Porfolio

I created this repository to demonstrate my skills as a Solidity developer. All projects were built using Hardhat, Ethers.js, TypeScript, Mocha, and Chai. Some of the projects have been deployed to testnets using Hardhat Ignition.

# List and description of Projects

- AutoMarketMaker

  This repository features a sample Automated Market Maker (AMM) that I developed to showcase my expertise in Smart Contract development using Solidity. The project architecture is inspired by the UniswapV2 protocol

  Simple Lottery that uses ChainLink `Automation` for execution automatically and ChainLink `VRF2.5` for requesting random numbers. Use ignition for deploy to Sepolia

- MyGovernace

  Inherit the base behavior from OpenZeppelin's `Governance` module and thoroughly test it.

- MyAPICaller (APIConsumer)

  Test base flow using ChainLink `APIConsumer` (Tests runned in Sepolia)
